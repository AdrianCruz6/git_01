## First Verse 

‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves. 
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
‘Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse

Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,  
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,  
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;  
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.  
The work of hunters is another thing:

## Third Verse

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:

## Last Verse

In the hush of morning’s breath,  
Where shadows linger, softly pressed,  
The world awakens from its rest,  
A canvas brushed with golden hues,  
Each ray a promise, bright and new.  

The dewdrops dance on blades of grass,  
A fleeting moment, here to pass,  
While birds compose a waking song,  
In melodies both sweet and strong.  

The sky, a tapestry unfurled,  
With colors spun from dreams,  
As sunbeams spill like liquid gold,  
Awakening slumbering streams.  

The trees stand tall, their branches sway,  
In gentle whispers, they convey. 
The stories of the night gone by,  
Secrets shared beneath the sky.  

A soft breeze carries scents of earth,  
Of flowers blooming, new rebirth,  
As nature stretches, yawns, and sighs,  
A symphony of life replies.  

The path ahead, a winding quest,  
With every step, a fleeting test,  
The laughter of the morning light. 
Invites the heart to take to flight.  

And in this moment, still and bright,  
Hope flickers like the stars at night,  
For every dawn brings forth a chance,  
To dream, to love, to dare, to dance.  

So let the whispers guide your way,  
Embrace the beauty of today,  
For life is but a fleeting song,  
A tapestry where we belong.
